# Rust BaseFinder

This repo contains the code for a website I created over 2 years ago - www.rustbasefinder.com .

I created the site over 2 years ago on the back of an idea I had when I was just 16. Since the the site has gathered:

- 300,000+ pageviews
- 47,000+ users
- 100+ base designs
- 1,000+ user accounts

The code in this repo is quite sloppy, on account of it being created when I was 16! Previously I have not uploaded this to GitHub for security concerns, 
however, I have ceased to maintain the site and I am keeping it live as part of my portfolio. 

## Please Note

I have removed all user data and site keys from this repo, however if you do happen to have any privacy concerns please contact me immediately.
